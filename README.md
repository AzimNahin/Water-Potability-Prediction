## Project Overview
The aim of this project is to classify water samples as potable or non-potable based on various chemical properties. It uses a dataset with attributes like pH, hardness, and solids to train a variety of machine learning models and evaluate their performance.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is sourced from [Kaggle's Water Potability Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/adityakadiwal/water-potability) and contains the following columns:
- **pH**: pH value of water
- **Hardness**: Measures water hardness
- **Solids**: Total dissolved solids (ppm)
- **Chloramines**: Chloramines level in ppm
- **Sulfate**: Sulfate concentration in ppm
- **Conductivity**: Electrical conductivity in Î¼S/cm
- **Organic Carbon**: Organic carbon concentration in ppm
- **Trihalomethanes**: Trihalomethanes concentration in ppm
- **Turbidity**: Turbidity level in NTU
- **Potability**: Indicates water potability (1: Potable, 0: Not Potable)

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Includes handling missing values, scaling, and imputing with mean values.
- **Feature Engineering**: Top features based on correlation are selected for model input.
- **Model Selection**: Models used include Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, AdaBoost, XGBoost, and Decision Tree.

## Modeling Approach
1. **Baseline Models**: Initial models trained individually to evaluate their performance.
2. **Stacking Ensemble**: Combines predictions of base models using a Logistic Regression meta-model.
3. **Voting Ensemble**: Uses a voting system across models to decide the final class prediction.

## Ensemble Learning
The stacking and voting ensemble methods are used to combine the strengths of multiple models, improving accuracy and robustness.

### Stacking
In stacking, predictions from each base model are combined, and a meta-model is trained on these predictions to make the final prediction.

### Voting
In voting, predictions from each model are averaged, and the final prediction is based on a threshold, classifying the sample as potable or non-potable.

## Performance Metrics
The following metrics are used to evaluate model performance:
- **Accuracy**: Overall accuracy of the predictions
- **Sensitivity**: True positive rate
- **Specificity**: True negative rate
- **Precision**: Positive predictive value
- **F1 Score**: Balance between precision and sensitivity
- **AUROC**: Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve
- **AUPR**: Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve

## Installation
